# Unit 3 Solo Project

## Overview ##

HÃ¡blame is a resource for learners of Spanish that pulls resources from Merriam Webster's dictionaryAPI and Linguatool from RapidAPI to look up translations as well as Spanish collocations and example sentences for those phrases. Users can save collocations they find useful for later reference.
